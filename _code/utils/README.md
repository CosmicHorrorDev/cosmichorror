## _WARNING_

These are all hastily-hacked together programs that are only intended to work
enough for the things I throw at it. If I need to throw more complicated things
at them then I'll just fix whatever problems surface

Turns out you can still throw together cursed garbage like this in Rust. Who
knew?
