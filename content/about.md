# Hi there :wave:

I'm Cosmic aka your typical drive-by-PR-andy that maintainers hate :D

This blog is just a place for me to give some context to sets of PRs that I
submit as well as giving me a place to reflect on what I’ve done. I’m a
passion-driven developer when it comes to OSS, so most of my work is sporadic
contributions to random Rust programs.
