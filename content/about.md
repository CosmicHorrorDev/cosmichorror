# Hi there :wave:

I'm Cosmic aka your typical drive-by-PR-Andy that maintainers hate :D

This blog is just a place for me to give some context to sets of PRs that I
submit as well as giving me a place to reflect on what Iâ€™ve done. Iâ€™m a
passion-driven developer when it comes to OSS, so most of my work is sporadic
contributions to random Rust crates.

## Security Questions

- Favorite Movie?
  - [Vivarium (2019)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivarium_(film)), but [The Cabin in the Woods (2011)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cabin_in_the_Woods) is a close second
- Favorite Book?
  - [House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Leaves) no contest
- Favorite Manga?
  - [Remina by Junji Ito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remina) (But [His other works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junji_Ito#Works) are phenomenal too)
