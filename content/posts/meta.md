# Hi there :wave:

So uhhh, fancy seeing you here.

I'm Cosmic and this blog is a place for me to give an overarching narrative to
some of my open source work as well as having a way to reflect on what I've
done.

<!--more-->

I'm a passion-driven developer when it comes to OSS, so most of my work will be
sporadic contributions to random Rust programs. I can't see myself dedicating
most of my time or energy to supporting a small set of projects, so instead I
work on fixing issues or building out features that come up from working on
other things. It's been an endless cycle, so I guess we'll see how long it
keeps up :sweat_smile:.
